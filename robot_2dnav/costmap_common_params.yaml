#thresholds on obstacle information

#obstacle range-the max range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put on map
#in meters. 2.5 = the robot will update its map with info about obstacles within 2.5m of base

obstacle_range: 2.5 


# raytrace range determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading.
#in meters. 3 = robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 3 meters away

raytrace_range: 3.0

#robot_radius: ir_of_robot - this is the robot's radius from center that influences which paths
# will be considered to avoid colision. To avoid colision, the center point of the robot should never # overlap with a cell that contains an inflated obstacle 
#robot_radius: 0.5
